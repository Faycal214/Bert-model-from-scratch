## Understanding BERT
**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model designed for natural language processing tasks. It uses a two-phase approach:

Pre-training on a large corpus to learn language representations.
Fine-tuning on specific tasks such as sentiment analysis or question answering.


## Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. In the case of **BERT**:

The model is pre-trained on a massive dataset (Translation_words_and_sentences_english_french).
You can fine-tune the model on your specific dataset, which allows it to adapt to the nuances of your task while leveraging the knowledge it gained during pre-training.
**BERT** is unique because it captures context from both directions (left and right), allowing for a better understanding of language.

## Training the Model
The training process involves two main tasks:

*Masked Language Modeling* (MLM): Predicting masked words in a sentence.
*Next Sentence Prediction* (NSP): Determining if one sentence follows another.
The loss functions for these tasks guide the optimization of the model's weights, and you can use optimizers like Adam to update them during training.

For a detailed explanation of the training process, check the ```pretrain_model``` script.
